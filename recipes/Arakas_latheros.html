    <h2>Cook`s note:</h2>
    <p><strong>
        In Greece, this dish is known as arakas latheros, which translates to "oiled peas." One of the lathera dishes, these "oil foods" feature olive oil as the main source of fat. However,  this version is  much lighter than the traditional version by using far less olive oil and more tomato to compensate.
